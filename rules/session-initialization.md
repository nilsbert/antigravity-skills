# Session Initialization (Rules)

## 5. Session Initialization (The Amy Kickstart)
*   **Mandatory Orientation**: Every new session or context switch **MUST** start with a call to the `context-recovery` skill (Amy). This ensures the agent is aligned with the project's current state, rules, and WIP limits.
