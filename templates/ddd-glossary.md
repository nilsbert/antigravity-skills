# Ubiquitous Language Glossary

> **Status:** Living Document
> **Goal:** Eliminate ambiguity. When we say "Card", we all mean the exact same thing.

## Terminology

| Term | Definition | Synonyms (Avoid) | Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Monster** | An entity that evolves based on study consistency. Has HP and Levels. | Pet, Avatar | Battle Context |

## Rules
1.  **Strict Usage:** If it's in the glossary, use it in the code (Class Names, Variable Names).
2.  **No Ambiguity:** A "User" in the *Auth Context* might be different from a "Player" in the *Battle Context*. Explicitly define differences.
